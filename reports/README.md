# Reports Directory

This directory contains analysis and audit reports generated during the tactile.js refactoring process.

## Report Files

### Data Extraction Reports
- **`data-extraction-report.json`** - Initial data extraction analysis
- **`data-extraction-report-v2.json`** - Enhanced data extraction with additional validation
- **`data-extraction-report-final.json`** - Final comprehensive data extraction report

### Audit Reports  
- **`tiling-data-audit-report.json`** - Complete audit of all 81 tiling types comparing old vs new data structures
- **`verification-report.json`** - Verification results of refactored code functionality

## Report Contents

### Data Extraction Reports
These reports document the process of extracting and validating tiling data from the original tactile.js library:
- Tiling type coverage analysis
- Data structure validation
- Parameter extraction results
- Edge shape mapping verification

### Audit Reports
These reports provide detailed analysis of data integrity and functionality:
- **Tiling Data Audit**: Compares original vs refactored data for all tiling types
- **Verification Report**: Validates that refactored code maintains identical functionality

## Usage

These reports were generated during the refactoring process to ensure:
1. No data was lost during modularization
2. All tiling types were properly extracted and validated
3. The refactored library maintains 100% compatibility with the original

The reports serve as documentation of the refactoring process and can be referenced for debugging or further development.
